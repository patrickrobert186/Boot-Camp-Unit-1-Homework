JP Morgan is trying to solve a whole range of problems facing B2B payments.  Fraud is actually a serious problem while 
over 50% of business report having attempted fraud.  Blockhain can also reduce the number of false positives when it comes 
to fraud.  Also Blockchain technology can provide for faster settlement and also would support frictionless payment.  Lastly
this type of technology can facilitate international business trancations, for example dramatically changing the need for 
letters of credit.  

JP Morgan provides a very strong balance sheet, both security and innovation, strong compliance and controls, and regulatory 
oversight.  Not to mention, the backing of one of the strongest brand name in global finance today. JP Morgan spends hundreds
of millions of dollars each year on cybersecurity and already has a Blockchain center of excellence.  And the JPM Coin will
be traded on Quorum blockchain, which was built by JP Morgan using the ethereum network.  And this blockchain is being used 
to run Interbank Information Network, a payment network that involves more than 300 banks.  

Currently only JP Morgan customers passing JP Morgan KYC can use these coins.  As of October, JPM Coin was being used 
successfully and JP Morgan formed a new business with 100 employees to house its blockchain and digital currency efforts.

JP Morgan should move to not only expand to other currencies, but use thier coins in multiple currencies to foster 
exchanges in currency.  And then they should move to set up an exchange to facilitate payments international 
business transactions.  

By facilitating these transactions, they can compete against new Fintech players in the market and replace other traditional 
banks in this market who have nothing to offer.  One new entrant is Airwallex, who secured $160 million in Series D funding 
in 2020, is looking to expand its cross border payment offerings.  It has announced a partnership with Visa to launch the 
Airwallex Boderless Card for businesses.
